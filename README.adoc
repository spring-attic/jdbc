# ATTENTION!

Do not attempt to use/build from `master`; the `master` branch is currently undergoing redesign to adapt to Spring Boot and Spring Cloud 2.0 stack. You'd notice discrepencies and/or test failures.

Please use/build the 1.3.x branch or the http://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/[Celsius.SR1 release] of the applications - it is the latest GA release.
